# Leaderboard
 
PLEASE READ:

As of 11/12/23 the current version of the project build is unable to create new leaderboard entries. I am using the legacy javascript code feature since it seems like its back. The code does not produce any errors in the unity editor or through PlayFab's legacy overview tab. I do not know what is preventing the code from working. I attatched below images of my Leaderboard configuration my C# code and my JavaScript code.

Besides this the Every other feature functions as intended as far as I am aware.
